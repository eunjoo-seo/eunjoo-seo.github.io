## About 
I am a Ph.D. student at the [Department of Operations and Decision Technologies](https://kelley.iu.edu/faculty-research/departments/operations-decision-technologies/index.html) at Kelley School of Business at [Indiana University Bloomington](https://bloomington.iu.edu/index.html). Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in Statistics and Economics from [Korea University](https://www.korea.edu/mbshome/mbs/en/index.do) in 2024.
